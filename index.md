### Clustering

[The Ultimate Statitical Fighter: UFC Fighter Segmentation](https://github.com/sgracia19/UFC-FIghter-Segmentation/blob/main/ufc-fighter-style-segmentation.ipynb)
Developed a data-driven clustering model to analyze fighter characteristics, fight outcomes, and fight metrics to identify
distinct fighting styles. Conducted feature engineering, correlation analysis, and visualization to refine insights. Evaluated
segmentation quality using Silhouette scores and within-cluster variance. Conducted matchup analysis to quantify stylistic
advantages, revealing trends in performance across fight styles and weight classes. Future work aims to expand dataset for
more robust classifications and to leverage cluster labels in predictive modeling.

### Reinforcment Learning
[Master's Research Project: Policy Gradient Methods in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/sgracia19/sgracia19.github.io/blob/main/Sebastian_Gracia_MS_project.pdf)
My master's research project gives an overview of the mathematical theory behind certain policy based methods in reinforcement learning. The project covers the basics of Reinforcement Learning, including MDPs, the agent-environment framework, and value functions. My research project goes on to cover the Policy Gradient Theorem and how it allows is Policy Gradient alrogirthms for reinforcement learning. My project then discuss a few selected algorithms and implementations on selected environments. For a condensed, slightly less technical outline of my project, see my [project defense slides]().

[Rainbow Road: Autonomous Driving using DQN Variants](https://github.com/sgracia19/sgracia19.github.io/blob/main/images/Final_Project_Report_Sebastian_Gracia.pdf) 
The reinforcement learning algorithm DQN introduced by Minh et. al has many different variants which
improve performance. This project implements the ideas presented by Matteo Hessel et al. showing that combinging many of the variants yields superior performance across different benchmarks than any single variant. The aim of this project was
to implement Rainbow DQN in a simple autonomous driving environment
and compare results obtained to results obtained to the paper. Underlying project code is currently unavailable due to losing access to the original account.ðŸ˜’

### Optimization
[Online Optimization using Greedy Projection Algorithm](https://github.com/sgracia19/sgracia19.github.io/blob/main/images/MATH_8110_Projects.pdf)
Online convex programming is a form of convex programming in which a convex
set is known ahead of time. At each iteration a point is selected from the convex
set then a repeated minimization problem is solved at the point. At each step
a corresponding cost function is evaluated. The cost function however is not
known ahead of time. This project explores an algorithm to minimize possible
costs incurred in an online convex problem. It is called the Greedy Projection
Algorithm. In this project, we introduce the background and properties of this
algorithm, then apply it by hand and numerically via MATLAB code to a set
of Online optimization problems, then discuss the results of each.
