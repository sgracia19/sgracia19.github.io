### Clustering

[The Ultimate Statitical Fighter: UFC Fighter Segmentation](https://github.com/sgracia19/UFC-FIghter-Segmentation/blob/main/ufc-fighter-style-segmentation.ipynb)
Developed a data-driven clustering model to analyze fighter characteristics, fight outcomes, and fight metrics to identify
distinct fighting styles. Conducted feature engineering, correlation analysis, and visualization to refine insights. Evaluated
segmentation quality using Silhouette scores and within-cluster variance. Conducted matchup analysis to quantify stylistic
advantages, revealing trends in performance across fight styles and weight classes. Future work aims to expand dataset for
more robust classifications and to leverage cluster labels in predictive modeling.
